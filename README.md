## This is my OLD project in C#

I started this project in February of 2021 and ended in the same month

The code looks like spaghetti. I had minimal experience in coding overall so that is why the code looks like that and has repeated blocks of code.

## Quick Start

It's probably not worth compiling this code but hey if you want to here you go.

You need to install [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) first.

Then compile with:

```shell
$ dotnet run
```
